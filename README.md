- Farmers face significant economic challenges due to the high costs of fertilizers and high-interest loans, which strain their financial stability and productivity, leading to suicides.

- To deal with such issues, our team has developed an Android application ‘AgriSmart’ which helps farmers prevent taking high-interest loans from landlords.

- Our Application provides low-cost services to farmers with real-time crop disease prediction and diagnosis and crop yield forecasting through satellite imagery.

## Unique Selling Point of our idea:

- Early Detection and Precision: Computer vision can detect symptoms of crop diseases at a much earlier stage than traditional methods and provides natural remedies as well.

- Scalability and Automation: Automated image analysis reduces the need for manual labor in inspecting crops, which is particularly beneficial in large-scale agricultural operations.

- Integration with Other Technologies: Combining computer vision with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can enable more detailed monitoring, such as environmental factors like temperature.
